## Introduction

The "Movie Recommendation System" project utilizes a dataset of movies and their attributes to suggest similar movies to users. By combining various textual features and applying cosine similarity, the system identifies movies with comparable themes, genres, and characteristics. The goal is to enhance users' movie exploration experience by providing tailored recommendations.

## Features

- Input your favorite movie and receive top movie recommendations.
- Utilizes natural language processing to process movie attributes.
- Calculates cosine similarity scores to determine movie similarity.
- Presents both a list of top 30 and refined top 10 recommended movies.
- Provides visualizations of the top 10 recommended movies.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, `difflib`, and `matplotlib`) installed.
2. Download or clone the project repository to your local machine.
3. Open the provided Jupyter Notebook file (`YBI_Final_project(Movie_recomand).ipynb`) in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
4. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to execute the recommendation system and visualizations.
5. Follow the prompts to input your favorite movie and view the recommendations.

## Installation

1. Install Python and Jupyter Notebook.
2. Clone this repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```
   
3. Navigate to the directory containing the notebook.
4. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells.

## Conclusion
This project employs Cosine Similarity and natural language processing to build a movie recommendation system. Users input their favorite movie, and the code suggests similar movies from a dataset based on genre, keywords, taglines, cast, and director. It calculates similarity scores, presents top 30 recommendations, and offers a refined list of top 10 choices for user input. A simple yet effective tool for discovering movies with thematic likeness, enhancing movie exploration.
